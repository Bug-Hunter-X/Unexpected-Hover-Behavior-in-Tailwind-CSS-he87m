```javascript
// Example showing an unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover over me!
</div>
```
The above code snippet intends to change the background color to blue when hovering. However, due to conflicting or missing configurations, the hover state may not work as expected. This could be caused by incorrect order of styles or missing important directives.
