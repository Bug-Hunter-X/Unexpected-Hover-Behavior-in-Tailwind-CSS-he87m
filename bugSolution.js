```javascript
// Solution: Ensuring correct style precedence and resolving conflicts
<div class="bg-red-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:bg-blue-700 important">
  Hover over me!
</div>
```
The solution adds the `important` directive to ensure that the hover style takes precedence. The `transition` and `duration` classes enhance the user experience by providing smooth transitions.
